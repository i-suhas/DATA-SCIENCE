Bitcoin Price Prediction
This project aims to predict Bitcoin prices using historical data and machine learning techniques.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is historical Bitcoin price data obtained from the CoinGecko API. The data includes timestamps and corresponding price values.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bitcoin-price-prediction.git
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Obtain the historical Bitcoin price data by making a request to the CoinGecko API or using your own dataset.

Preprocess the data:

Convert timestamps to dates.
Handle missing values, if any.
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Train the prediction model:

Select a suitable machine learning algorithm (e.g., linear regression, random forest, LSTM).
Implement the model using your preferred machine learning library (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch).
Train the model on the training data.
Evaluate the model:

Predict Bitcoin prices using the trained model.
Calculate evaluation metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE).
Assess the performance of the model on the testing data.
Visualize the predictions:

Use data visualization libraries like matplotlib or seaborn to plot the actual and predicted Bitcoin prices.
Analyze and interpret the results.
